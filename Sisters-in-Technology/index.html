        <p>&emsp;Sisters in Technology is an after school club that encourages young women of all backgrounds to explore
          technology with the added goal of helping all of our members find possible futures in technology that they
          will LOVE! We are currently working with web design, micro controllers and robots, but are willing to explore
          any technology interests of our members.
          <br>
          <br>
          &emsp; Outside of school, we take awesome field trips to meet with technology professionals and get to see for
          our selves what working in tech can look like. We also have a partnership with Minneapolis Community Education
          giving club members the opportunity to GET PAID over the summer for teaching technology skills to elementary
          and middle school students.
